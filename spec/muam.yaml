        Will result in an e-mail being sent with an access code. The access code
        will have a 15 minute timeout.

        No new reset codes will be able to be generated for the same email
        address within the timeout window.

        Will generate a refresh token if the email address is valid, the PUT
        verb for this endpoint will require

        a valid refresh token.
